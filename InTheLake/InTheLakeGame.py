#A text version of a swedish card game for children. Currently supporting 1 player + computer.
#Original title in swedish is "Finns i sjÃ¶n".

#Rules:
#Every player gets seven cards on hand. The rest of the cards are spread in the lake.
#Now you need to collect four's. You do this by asking your oponents after the cards you wish to have.
#When you have four cards of a given value you get one point. The one who gets most points when the game is over has won.
#If you get out of cards you pick 7 new ones, if the lake is empty you have to wait for the next game.

#Rules on swedish: https://www.spelregler.org/finns-i-sjon/
